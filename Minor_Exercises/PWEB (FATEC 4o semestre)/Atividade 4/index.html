                        Both colors want to improve the world. White does this in its quest to promote peace, while Blue
                        does it out of its interest in reaching perfection. The end result is the same. Both colors like
                        to force its rules and ways upon all those around them"</em>

                    Dimir's guildmages use their magic to influence the minds of others. They can send messages to
                    operatives over distances, strike people with amnesia, magically alter memories, or even perform
                    lobotomies on victims to cover their tracks. The Dimir also practice necromancy, creating undead
                    minions such as skeletons and wights to carry out missions. Such minions are employed as they are
                    single-minded, easy to create and dispose of, cannot be interrogated in the event of capture and are
                    easily blamed on the Golgari instead. Spirits are also used by the Dimir to pass on messages, carry
                    out surveillance invisibly, or even to possess important figures such as judges and senators. Nobody
                    is beyond the reach of House Dimir.

                    <em> </em>
                    Rakdos embodies hedonism and is known for his capricious cruelty and megalomania. Older than the
                    Guildpact itself, Rakdos is an ancient, powerful, and evil demon who personifies the chaotic fury of
                    red mana and the death and defilement of black.[7] He is also a consummate entertainer, whose mere
                    appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall,
                    spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the
                    spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.[8] Rakdos' armour resembles the signet of the Rakdos
                    guild.

                    <em> </em>
                    <p>Before and for a short time after the signing of the Guildpact, the Gruul Clans were a wild and
                        noble guild charged with maintaining the wild places on Ravnica.[1] They were supposed to keep
                        civilization in check. Civilization and the other nine guilds, however, overran every wild place
                        on the plane. This changed the Gruul.[2]
                    </p>
                    <p>As the wilds were torn down, so too were the Gruul's responsibilities taken from them. The Simic
                        claimed jurisdiction over nature's future. The Selesnya preached about nature in order to bring
                        it into its conclave. With their responsibilities taken over by others, they were seen as
                        outside of the Guildpact and the Azorius began to write them out of the law. Outside the law,
                        the Boros were not required to protect them and the Orzhov were free to enslave them. </p>
