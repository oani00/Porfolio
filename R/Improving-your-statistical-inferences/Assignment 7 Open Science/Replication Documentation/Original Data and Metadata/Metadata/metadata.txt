1) A citation to the website from which you downloaded the data.

https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

2) The data you downloaded, and a description of how others can access this data
(e.g., the search terms you used).

There are ways to acess IMDB`s database, but I`m not so used to programming so I searched for "imdb csv" in google. It quickly gotme to kaggle wich stores various databases for ready use.

3) Some information that will allow readers to understand the original data. This
information should be similar to a ‘codebook’. In our simple datafile, this will
be straightforward, but in larger datasets, this requires careful work.

It's a simple csv, no secrets.

4) If you use existing datasets, a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) assigned to the
dataset, if available. This is not needed for our project.
