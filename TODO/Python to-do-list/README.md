# to-do-list

A historic repo, the first I created when I registered on GitHub (dec 2019).

The goal is to create a simple to-do list using python (the only language I know about at the time)

Now, 4th semester at FATEC, I can make some usefull comments.

Without looking at any tutorial, there are several ways to implement it. Maybe create a struct "post" or simply make a great matrix with the atributes. As I'm not verset at Python, I don't know the libraries and methods avaiable, but in the end It will fall into getters and setters (I've heart python supports OOP, so a post class and instances would be ideal).

Back then I thought this task would be very very difficult, but now it's just a matter of good organization of classes and instances. Of course, without taking into consideration the front-end part of it, wich would maybe be the hardest part.
